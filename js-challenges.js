Objective

Preloaded for you is a class Dog:

class Dog {
  constructor(name, age, gender, species, size, master, loyal) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = species;
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = size;
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = loyal;
  }
}

You are then given a working class Labrador as your initial code.

class Labrador {
  constructor(name, age, gender, master) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.species = "Labrador";
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = "Large";
    this.master = master;
    this.loyal = true;
  }
}

Shorten it so that it meets the strict character count requirements for this Kata.

Quick, get your timer out and get ready to time yourself. Are you ready? Ready, get set, GO!!! :D

class Labrador extends Dog {
  constructor(name,age,gender,master,species,legs,size,loyal) {
    super(name,age,gender)
    this.master = master;
    this.species = "Labrador";
    this.legs = 4;
    this.size = "Large";
    this.loyal = true;
  }
}

/////// Parse nice int from char problem ///////
/*
You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.

/////// JADEN CASE STRINGS ///////
/*Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
*/

String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
  return this.split(" ")
              .map((word,i) => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase())
               .join(" ")
};
